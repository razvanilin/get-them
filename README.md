get-them
========

This is a game I created during a 10 hours jam, featuring santa who jumped off his carriage to get the lost gifts. You have to control him mid-air and take as many gifts as you can. You also have to mind the speed by hitting clouds to make sure you deaccelerate the fall.

Android optimized app. Move character using the accelerometer sensor.

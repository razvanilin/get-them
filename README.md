get-them
========

This app was started during a 10-hours app jam. I kept on improving the app.

The game features Alt, who is falling and he is trying to get the things he dropped mid-air.

Android optimized app. Move character using the accelerometer sensor.

NOTE: The app's menu will look ok only on 720p screens and above. I will try to make it look ok for other screens soon.
